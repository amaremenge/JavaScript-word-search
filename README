Trie dictionary word search

The idea of the project is to find all possible words from given letters in a given word dictionary.

Project summary:
Trie structure enables words to be found from given letters very fast. HTML GUI and JavaScript allows us to run the word search on most systems, even phones and tablets.

Usage:

This word search works in most browsers that support JavaScript.

Download the project. Substitute dict.txt with your list of words. Each word must be separated by a new line. Convert the text dictionary to JSON trie dictionary by running txt2trieDictConvert.py (python txt2trieDictConvert.py dict.txt). Open html5.html with a browser (was tested with Firefox). Enter letters in the search box and press Submit Query.
Note: Chrome will not load JavaScript locally with default security settings.
The project can be easily deployed on a server. The following files should be copied to the server directory: dict.js, find-words.js, jquery-1.7.min.js, html5.html, and html5.css.
